Next tech steps:

For visualization:
- Make home folder also a persistent volume (vscode stuff is installed here, plus other default stuff)
- Maybe add NPM/NPX for node stuff
- Use "Bit" or "Vite" to help with react development (+webpack, babel, eslint, etc.; these are included in Bit, I think)
- Add these to dockerfile



For backend:
- Get node_server down
- Get FHIR logic down
